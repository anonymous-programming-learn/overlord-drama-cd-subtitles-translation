Dialogue: 0,0:09:31.25,0:09:40.20,Default,,0,0,0,,Yes! I was thinking if we had an ocean near the jungle in the 6th floor, we could raise many more animals and plants!
Dialogue: 0,0:09:40.20,0:09:44.55,Default,,0,0,0,,You... There　is something called a limit in everything!
Dialogue: 0,0:09:44.55,0:09:48.65,Default,,0,0,0,,Was that no　good, after all?
Dialogue: 0,0:09:48.65,0:09:54.70,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, for now I am just hearing your opinions.

Dialogue: 0,0:10:05.40,0:10:14.70,Default,,0,0,0,,You see, I want more variation. Fire torturing, water torturing,　ishidaki (rock cradling), medication and　maybe Sai no Kawara (Torture of Dead Men) could be good too.

Dialogue: 0,0:10:26.70,0:10:30.65,Default,,0,0,0,,How.is.That.Any.Different From.a.Torture.Room?
Dialogue: 0,0:10:30.65,0:10:37.05,Default,,0,0,0,,Training and torture is entirely different! You can't call it training, if you don't put love in it!
Dialogue: 0,0:10:37.05,0:10:41.65,Default,,0,0,0,,You can't call it torture either if you don't do it with love, Aura.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:41.65,0:10:42.65,Default,,0,0,0,,Is that so?
Dialogue: 0,0:10:42.65,0:10:46.85,Default,,0,0,0,,Ainz-sama! May I humbly ask for something?

Dialogue: 0,0:11:10.05,0:11:12.65,Default,,0,0,0,,It doesn't concern you does it?
Dialogue: 0,0:11:12.65,0:11:22.25,Default,,0,0,0,,Well if you want to make one, you can do it, but I will be partaking in the design.

Dialogue: 0,0:11:31.85,0:11:38.35,Default,,0,0,0,,Of course, I will be first one who will be using that room after all.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:38.35,0:11:44.40,Default,,0,0,0,,It seems like we need to settle this fight, Shalltear.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:44.40,0:11:50.55,Default,,0,0,0,,Oh, why do we need to carry out a fight that we know the result of?
