Dialogue: 0,0:04:22.70,0:04:31.33,Default,,0,0,0,,Uh...I really appreciate Ainz-sama's kindness but, I think it's not fair that I'm the only one receiving a reward.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:32.13,0:04:32.88,Default,,0,0,0,,Is that so?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:33.03,0:04:42.03,Default,,0,0,0,,The other Guardians are also working hard for Ainz-sama's sake as well. Being the only one to receive a reward feels really weird.
