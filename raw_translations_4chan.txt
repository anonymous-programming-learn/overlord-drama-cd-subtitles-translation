Alright, got them.
For starters


7:28 Actually to repay everyone's work, I am planning to introduce a welfare system to Nazarick.
7:38 Wel-fare system? What is that?
7:46 The world that I was previously living in had something called a 'company'
7:50 Well, you could think of it as something like a guild.
7:52 It would take a long time if I were to explain it in detail... 
7:55 Basically it is the name of the system a company offers to their members, to help them work comfortably.
8:02 (In reality there are many companies that don't maintain it though. I have never　benefited from it after all.)
8:12 A service, huh...
8:14 Exactly. For a start, I am thinking of building　new facilities that you wish for inside Nazarick.
8:25 Making Nazarick more comfortable would contribute to the reinforcement of Nazarick after all.
8:28 Do you have any wishes?

8:31 Ainz-sama... I think it is a great　proposal, but in my opinion Nazarick already　has enough variety of facilities already.
8:43 9th floor even has a Spa Resort and a Bar after all.
8:46 There is even a Nail Saloon. Thanks to that I can preserve my beautiful nails.
8:52 From.a.Snowy.Mountain, to.a.Jungle. I.Think.it.Would.be.Harder.to Find.Something.We.Don't.Have.
9:01 Hmmm, I see... 
9:03 Umm... 
9:03 Oh, it's rare to see Mare speak!
9:08 Recently, after talking with Ainz-sama I was thinking about it...
9:15 No need to be reserved, Nazarick is your　place too. Any kind of wish will be made real.
9:27 Then.. I want to request an ocean!
9:30 An ocean, is it?
9:31 Yes! I was thinking if we had an ocean near the jungle in the 6th floor, we could raise many more animals and plants!
9:40 You... There　is something called a limit in everything!
9:44 Was that no　good, after all?
9:49 Well, for now I am just hearing your opinions.
9:53 Hmmm... If I were to say it, maybe a torture room?
10:02 We.Already.Have.a.Torture.Room in.the.5th.Floor don't.We?
10:05 You see, I want more variation. Fire torturing, water torturing,　ishidaki (rock cradling), medication and　maybe Sai no Kawara (Torture of Dead Men) could be good too.
10:15 I-I see...
10:18 What about you onee-chan?
10:20 Me? I guess maybe an animal training facility that I can swing my whip　with all my strength. 
10:26 How.Different.is.That From.a.Torture.Room?

It seems Demiurge is planning to torture people even after death.

Oops, forgot to recheck beforehand.

8:31 Ainz-sama... I think it is a great proposal, but Nazarick already has enough variety of facilities in my opinion.

8:46 There is even a Nail Saloon. Thanks to that I can preserve my beautiful nails.

I also disabled full width spaces so that shouldn't happen again.

10:30 Training and torture is entirely different! You can't call it training, if you don't put love in it!
10:37 You can't call it torture either if you don't do it with love, Aura.
10:41 Is that so?
10:42 Ainz-sama! May I humbly ask for something?
10:46 Y-Yeah. I don't mind.
10:49 If it can be done, could we have a children's room?
10:54 Haah?
10:57 It would have pink walls, a hanging toy from the ceiling and a baby bed at the center.
11:06 Why would you need such a thing?
11:10 It doesn't concern you does it?
11:15 Well if you want to make one, you can do it, but I will be partaking in the design.
11:22 The walls black, the hanging toy will be a bat and the baby bed will be changed into a cradle.
11:29 Why are you intervening!?
11:33 Of course, I will be first one who will be using that room after all.
11:38 It seems like we need to settle this fight, Shalltear.
11:44 Oh, why do we need to carry out a fight that we know the result of?
11:50 Yes you are right, of course I will be the one who bears the child of the Supreme Being even if we don't...
11:58 Ainz-sama, lets talk about the decoration of the room!
12:03 GET AWAY FROM AINZ-SAMA YOU BITCH!
12:07 BE QUIET!!
12:10 I am very sorry!
12:11 Forgive my insolence!
12:15 Isn't this a Déjà vu?
12:18 Sigh... This topic will be carried over to the next discussion. Dismissed!
12:27 Ainz-sama, where are you going?
12:30 Its a personal business.

First part is done. Going to sleep for two days now so hopefully someone better than me will continue.

10:26 How.is.That.Any.Different From.a.Torture.Room?

We can fix any other mistakes on the .ass.
