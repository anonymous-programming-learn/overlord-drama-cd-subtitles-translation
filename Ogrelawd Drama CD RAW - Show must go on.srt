1
00:00:04,067 --> 00:00:09,200
Alright everybody, just a little bit more and it's finished!Show some spirit!

2
00:00:13,367 --> 00:00:16,100
O-onee-chan! What's this?

3
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:18,934
Ah Mare, what's up?

4
00:00:19,634 --> 00:00:29,408
 I got curious since I heard loud noises. Onee-chan, to call upon a huge pack of dragonkin, What are you making?

5
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:32,000
Hm-hmm! What do you think?

6
00:00:32,734 --> 00:00:37,182
I wonder...It looks like another Nazarick but...

7
00:00:37,301 --> 00:00:43,408
Exactly! What I'm making is another underground Nazarick! (the entrance way)

8
00:00:44,234 --> 00:00:44,602
Ehh!!

9
00:00:44,802 --> 00:00:53,908
ï»¿It not just on the outside but the inside is identical too! Well~,amazing right?...Wait, why do you look so frightened?
ï»¿

10
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:56,700
N-no way...O-onee-chan...

11
00:00:58,835 --> 00:00:59,410
What?

12
00:00:59,668 --> 00:01:01,934
I-it's n-nothing...

13
00:01:02,167 --> 00:01:05,620
Don't try to avoid the topic, give it to me straight!

14
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:16,641
Ueehawawawawa I-I get it!Onee-chan, are you planning to declare independence from Nazarick...?

15
00:01:16,801 --> 00:01:20,880
Haaa? Obviously that's not gonna happen.What the heck are you saying?

16
00:01:21,101 --> 00:01:28,167
Ueh~! B-but t-there's no need to make a large base...like this...

17
00:01:28,367 --> 00:01:34,207
Haaa...You...I made this because--

18
00:01:36,901 --> 00:01:38,916
...! This presence!

19
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,359
Gate,Close.

20
00:01:42,567 --> 00:01:43,530
Ainz-sama!

21
00:01:43,867 --> 00:01:46,645
Looks like progress is going smoothly, Aura.

22
00:01:46,968 --> 00:01:49,737
A-ainz-sama!! You came to visit me?

23
00:01:50,234 --> 00:01:56,734
Oh-you've managed to do all this in such a short time. I appreciate it, Aura.

24
00:01:57,101 --> 00:02:03,801
Ehehe~you don't have to thank me~This is Ainz-sama's orders so it's a given!

25
00:02:04,134 --> 00:02:11,201
Eh,then...It was Ainz-sama's order to make another Nazarick?

26
00:02:11,401 --> 00:02:25,002
Indeed. We don't know when an invader will come so it is necessary to prepare a dummy Nazarick to lure them in for when that happens.

27
00:02:25,202 --> 00:02:30,000
This just another form of Nazarick defensive countermeasures.

28
00:02:30,768 --> 00:02:34,600
Wow~So that explains it~

29
00:02:35,467 --> 00:02:37,836
Hm? What's the matter?

30
00:02:38,034 --> 00:02:45,167
Ah no, I thought...Onee-chan was planning to go independent.

31
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,433
(Eh? Independent?)

32
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:51,101
Like I was saying! That's never gonna happen!

33
00:02:51,434 --> 00:02:55,568
UheH! Ouch....Sorry Onee-chan~

34
00:02:55,934 --> 00:03:00,267
Geez! Ainz-sama, please don't misunderstand, okay?

35
00:03:00,968 --> 00:03:08,001
I see. (Aura's declaring independence? That's not possible! But,there's Shalltear's case too...)

36
00:03:09,434 --> 00:03:19,133
Aaahh *ahem* Aura, Is there something you're unsatisfied in your daily life?

37
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:21,600
Ehh? You mean me?

38
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:36,467
Yes, you all work your hardest all the time for my sake. In spite of this, I have given no reward in return. Is there something I can do for you?

39
00:03:36,901 --> 00:03:42,100
W-what are you saying, Ainz-sama. Giving a reward is too much~...

40
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:49,567
T-that's right! Being able to serve Ainz-sama is a reward in itself!

41
00:03:50,134 --> 00:03:55,967
I'm glad to hear you all say that but, this is something I personally wish for as well.

42
00:03:56,634 --> 00:03:57,867
Ainz-sama's?

43
00:03:58,767 --> 00:04:06,366
Renumerating subordinates for their work is the duty of those in the top and at the same time their happiness.

44
00:04:08,272 --> 00:04:11,500
Now then Aura,is there something you want?

45
00:04:12,134 --> 00:04:15,001
I-it's a little too sudden to ask me this...

46
00:04:15,733 --> 00:04:22,234
You've already accomplished the feat of constructing this dummy Nazarick.There's no need to hold back, you know?

47
00:04:22,901 --> 00:04:31,533
Uh...I really appreciate Ainz-sama's kindness but, I think it's not fair that I'm the only one receiving a reward.

48
00:04:32,334 --> 00:04:33,088
Is that so?

49
00:04:33,233 --> 00:04:42,234
The other Guardians are also working hard for Ainz-sama's sake as well. Being the only one to receive a reward feels really weird.

50
00:04:42,834 --> 00:04:50,101
T-that's true...if only Onee-chan gets a reward and Albedo-san and Shalltear-san finds out...!

51
00:04:51,267 --> 00:04:54,801
(Right...It's gonna be troublesome.)

52
00:04:56,733 --> 00:05:02,134
I understand. We will discuss this at the next meeting.

53
00:05:02,534 --> 00:05:04,833
I think that's a very good idea, Ainz-sama!

54
00:05:05,734 --> 00:05:07,001
Well then, farewell.

55
00:05:10,267 --> 00:05:12,101
Ahhh...Aura,...

56
00:05:12,301 --> 00:05:13,567
I-is something the matter?

57
00:05:14,834 --> 00:05:16,801
Looking forward to working with you again from now on.

58
00:05:17,466 --> 00:05:19,134
!!..Yes!

59
00:05:24,068 --> 00:05:28,967
--that is all for the agenda for today, any questions?

60
00:05:29,634 --> 00:05:33,434
There is one last thing I'd like to talk about if you don't mind, Albedo.

61
00:05:33,634 --> 00:05:38,634
Ainz-sama, of course. Please discuss it with us.

62
00:05:40,501 --> 00:05:48,468
First of all, I would like to thank you all for coming today. I am very grateful to all your daily work.

63
00:05:48,668 --> 00:05:58,733
Ainz-sama! Your words are wasted on us. However, we are all working all for the sake of--

64
00:05:58,933 --> 00:06:02,467
Albedo! I'm still in the middle of talking.

65
00:06:02,667 --> 00:06:05,300
!!My deepest apologies.

66
00:06:06,101 --> 00:06:11,734
Kefufufufu~ Looks like your point-earning has failed~

67
00:06:12,334 --> 00:06:15,734
Oh my Shalltear, Whatever do you mean by that?

68
00:06:15,934 --> 00:06:19,935
All your buttering up is having the reverse effect.

69
00:06:20,135 --> 00:06:28,101
Buttering up!? All I want is to confess my honest feelings as Ainz-sama's faithful servant!

70
00:06:28,301 --> 00:06:31,233
A faithful servant, you say?

71
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:41,268
--is a faithful servant supposed to have a hug pillow of her master and drools all over it?

72
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:49,767
Shalltear, embarrassing me in front of the Supreme One, You'd better be prepared.

73
00:06:49,967 --> 00:06:58,934
Ara ara~there are wrinkles forming on your face~isn't that a big problem for a succubus?

74
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,801
Let's settle this outside!!

75
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,833
Enough.of this.already! We are.before the.Supreme One.

76
00:07:08,834 --> 00:07:09,735
Hh! My deepest apologies!

77
00:07:09,935 --> 00:07:11,134
I'm terribly sorry!

78
00:07:12,368 --> 00:07:15,468
What.a shameless.bunch.

79
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:20,333
This happens all the time, it's about time you learn from it.

80
00:07:21,834 --> 00:07:26,667
If you may, Ainz-sama, Please continue the rest.
