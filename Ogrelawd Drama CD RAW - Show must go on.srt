1
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:09,000
Alright everybody, just a little bit more and it's finished!Show some spirit!

2
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,900
O-onee-chan! What's this?

3
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:18,730
Ah Mare, what's up?

4
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:29,200
 I got curious since I heard loud noises. Onee-chan, to call upon a huge pack of dragonkin, What are you making?

5
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:31,800
Hm-hmm! What do you think?

6
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:37,280
I wonder...It looks like another Nazarick but...

7
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:43,200
Exactly! What I'm making is another underground Nazarick! (the entrance way)

8
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:44,200
Ehh!!

9
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:53,700
It not just on the outside but the inside is identical too! Well~,amazing right?...Wait, why do you look so frightened?
ï»¿

10
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,500
N-no way...O-onee-chan...

11
00:00:58,630 --> 00:00:59,210
What?

12
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,730
I-it's n-nothing...

13
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:06,120
Don't try to avoid the topic, give it to me straight!

14
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:09,300
Ueehawawawawa I-I get it!

15
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:16,440
Onee-chan, are you planning to declare independence from Nazarick...?

16
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:20,680
Haaa? Obviously that's not gonna happen.What the heck are you saying?

17
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:27,960
Ueh~! B-but t-there's no need to make a large base...like this...

18
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:34,000
Haaa...You...I made this because--

19
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,710
...! This presence!

20
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,150
Gate,Close.

21
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,330
Ainz-sama!

22
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,440
Looks like progress is going smoothly, Aura.

23
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:49,680
A-ainz-sama!! You came to visit me?

24
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:56,530
Oh-you've managed to do all this in such a short time. I appreciate it, Aura.

25
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:03,600
Ehehe~you don't have to thank me~This is Ainz-sama's orders so it's a given!

26
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:11,340
Eh,then...It was Ainz-sama's order to make another Nazarick?

27
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:18,560
Indeed. We don't know when an invader will come.

28
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:24,800
So it is necessary to prepare a dummy Nazarick to lure them in for when that happens.

29
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:29,800
This just another form of Nazarick defensive countermeasures.

30
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,400
Wow~So that explains it~

31
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,630
Hm? What's the matter?

32
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:44,960
Ah no, I thought...Onee-chan was planning to go independent.

33
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,230
(Eh? Independent?)

34
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:50,900
Like I was saying! That's never gonna happen!

35
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:55,360
UheH! Ouch....Sorry Onee-chan~

36
00:02:55,730 --> 00:03:00,060
Geez! Ainz-sama, please don't misunderstand, okay?

37
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,060
I see.

38
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:07,800
(Aura's declaring independence? That's not possible! But,there's Shalltear's case too...)

39
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:13,400
Aaahh *ahem* Aura

40
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,200
What do you want, Ainz-sama?

41
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,930
Is there something you're unsatisfied in your daily life?

42
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:21,400
Ehh? You mean me?

43
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:28,250
Yes, you all work your hardest all the time for my sake.

44
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:36,260
In spite of this, I have given no reward in return. Is there something I can do for you?

45
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:41,900
W-what are you saying, Ainz-sama. Giving a reward is too much~...

46
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:49,360
T-that's right! Being able to serve Ainz-sama is a reward in itself!

47
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:55,760
I'm glad to hear you all say that but, this is something I personally wish for as well.

48
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:57,660
Ainz-sama's?

49
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:06,160
Renumerating subordinates for their work is the duty of those in the top and at the same time their happiness.

50
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:11,300
Now then Aura,is there something you want?

51
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:14,800
I-it's a little too sudden to ask me this...

52
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:22,030
You've already accomplished the feat of constructing this dummy Nazarick.There's no need to hold back, you know?

53
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:31,330
Uh...I really appreciate Ainz-sama's kindness but, I think it's not fair that I'm the only one receiving a reward.

54
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:32,880
Is that so?

55
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:42,030
The other Guardians are also working hard for Ainz-sama's sake as well. Being the only one to receive a reward feels really weird.

56
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:49,900
T-that's true...if only Onee-chan gets a reward and Albedo-san and Shalltear-san finds out...!

57
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:54,600
(Right...It's gonna be troublesome.)

58
00:04:56,530 --> 00:05:01,930
I understand. We will discuss this at the next meeting.

59
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:04,630
I think that's a very good idea, Ainz-sama!

60
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:06,800
Well then, farewell.

61
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,900
Ahhh...Aura,...

62
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,360
I-is something the matter?

63
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:16,600
Looking forward to working with you.

64
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:18,930
!!..Yes!

65
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:28,760
--that is all for the agenda for today, any questions?

66
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:33,230
There is one last thing I'd like to talk about if you don't mind, Albedo.

67
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:38,430
Ainz-sama, of course. Please discuss it with us.

68
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:48,260
First of all, I would like to thank you all for coming today. I am very grateful to all your daily work.

69
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:58,530
Ainz-sama! Your words are wasted on us. However, we are all working all for the sake of--

70
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:02,260
Albedo! I'm still in the middle of talking.

71
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:05,100
!!My deepest apologies.

72
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:11,530
Kefufufufu~ Looks like your point-earning has failed~

73
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:15,530
Oh my Shalltear, Whatever do you mean by that?

74
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:19,730
All your buttering up is having the reverse effect.

75
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:28,550
Buttering up!? All I want is to confess my honest feelings as Ainz-sama's faithful servant!

76
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:31,030
A faithful servant, you say?

77
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:41,060
--is a faithful servant supposed to have a hug pillow of her master and drools all over it?

78
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:49,560
Shalltear, embarrassing me in front of the Supreme One, You'd better be prepared.

79
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:58,730
Ara ara~there are wrinkles forming on your face~isn't that a big problem for a succubus?

80
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,600
Let's settle this outside!!

81
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:07,630
Enough.of this.already! We are.before the.Supreme One.

82
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:09,530
Hh! My deepest apologies!

83
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:10,930
I'm terribly sorry!

84
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,260
What.a shameless.bunch.

85
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:20,130
This happens all the time, it's about time you learn from it.

86
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:26,460
If you may, Ainz-sama, Please continue the rest.
