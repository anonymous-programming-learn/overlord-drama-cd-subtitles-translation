1
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:09,000
Alright everybody, just a little bit more and it's finished!Show some spirit!

2
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,900
O-onee-chan! What's this?

3
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:18,730
Ah Mare, what's up?

4
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:29,200
 I got curious since I heard loud noises. Onee-chan, to call upon a huge pack of dragonkin, What are you making?

5
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:31,800
Hm-hmm! What do you think?

6
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:37,280
I wonder...It looks like another Nazarick but...

7
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:43,200
Exactly! What I'm making is another underground Nazarick! (the entrance way)

8
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:44,200
Ehh!!

9
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:53,700
It not just on the outside but the inside is identical too! Well~,amazing right?...Wait, why do you look so frightened?
ï»¿

10
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,500
N-no way...O-onee-chan...

11
00:00:58,630 --> 00:00:59,210
What?

12
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,730
I-it's n-nothing...

13
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:06,120
Don't try to avoid the topic, give it to me straight!

14
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:09,300
Ueehawawawawa I-I get it!

15
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:16,440
Onee-chan, are you planning to declare independence from Nazarick...?

16
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:20,680
Haaa? Obviously that's not gonna happen.What the heck are you saying?

17
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:27,960
Ueh~! B-but t-there's no need to make a large base...like this...

18
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:34,000
Haaa...You...I made this because--

19
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,710
...! This presence!

20
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,150
Gate,Close.

21
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,330
Ainz-sama!

22
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,440
Looks like progress is going smoothly, Aura.

23
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:49,680
A-ainz-sama!! You came to visit me?

24
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:56,530
Oh-you've managed to do all this in such a short time. I appreciate it, Aura.

25
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:03,600
Ehehe~you don't have to thank me~This is Ainz-sama's orders so it's a given!

26
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:11,340
Eh,then...It was Ainz-sama's order to make another Nazarick?

27
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:18,560
Indeed. We don't know when an invader will come.

28
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:24,800
So it is necessary to prepare a dummy Nazarick to lure them in for when that happens.

29
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:29,800
This just another form of Nazarick defensive countermeasures.

30
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,400
Wow~So that explains it~

31
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,630
Hm? What's the matter?

32
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:44,960
Ah no, I thought...Onee-chan was planning to go independent.

33
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,230
(Eh? Independent?)

34
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:50,900
Like I was saying! That's never gonna happen!

35
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:55,360
UheH! Ouch....Sorry Onee-chan~

36
00:02:55,730 --> 00:03:00,060
Geez! Ainz-sama, please don't misunderstand, okay?

37
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,060
I see.

38
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:07,800
(Aura's declaring independence? That's not possible! But,there's Shalltear's case too...)

39
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:13,400
Aaahh *ahem* Aura

40
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,200
What do you want, Ainz-sama?

41
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,930
Is there something you're unsatisfied in your daily life?

42
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:21,400
Ehh? You mean me?

43
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:28,250
Yes, you all work your hardest all the time for my sake.

44
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:36,260
In spite of this, I have given no reward in return. Is there something I can do for you?

45
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:41,900
W-what are you saying, Ainz-sama. Giving a reward is too much~...

46
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:49,360
T-that's right! Being able to serve Ainz-sama is a reward in itself!

47
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:55,760
I'm glad to hear you all say that but, this is something I personally wish for as well.

48
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:57,660
Ainz-sama's?

49
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:06,160
Renumerating subordinates for their work is the duty of those in the top and at the same time their happiness.

50
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:11,300
Now then Aura,is there something you want?

51
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:14,800
I-it's a little too sudden to ask me this...

52
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:22,030
You've already accomplished the feat of constructing this dummy Nazarick.There's no need to hold back, you know?

53
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:31,330
Uh...I really appreciate Ainz-sama's kindness but, I think it's not fair that I'm the only one receiving a reward.

54
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:32,880
Is that so?

55
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:42,030
The other Guardians are also working hard for Ainz-sama's sake as well. Being the only one to receive a reward feels really weird.

56
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:49,900
T-that's true...if only Onee-chan gets a reward and Albedo-san and Shalltear-san finds out...!

57
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:54,600
(Right...It's gonna be troublesome.)

58
00:04:56,530 --> 00:05:01,930
I understand. We will discuss this at the next meeting.

59
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:04,630
I think that's a very good idea, Ainz-sama!

60
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:06,800
Well then, farewell.

61
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,900
Ahhh...Aura,...

62
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,360
I-is something the matter?

63
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:16,600
Looking forward to working with you.

64
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:18,930
!!..Yes!

65
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:28,760
--that is all for the agenda for today, any questions?

66
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:33,230
There is one last thing I'd like to talk about if you don't mind, Albedo.

67
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:38,430
Ainz-sama, of course. Please discuss it with us.

68
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:48,260
First of all, I would like to thank you all for coming today. I am very grateful to all your daily work.

69
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:58,530
Ainz-sama! Your words are wasted on us. However, we are all working all for the sake of--

70
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:02,260
Albedo! I'm still in the middle of talking.

71
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:05,100
!!My deepest apologies.

72
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:11,530
Kefufufufu~ Looks like your point-earning has failed~

73
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:15,530
Oh my Shalltear, Whatever do you mean by that?

74
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:19,730
All your buttering up is having the reverse effect.

75
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:28,550
Buttering up!? All I want is to confess my honest feelings as Ainz-sama's faithful servant!

76
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:31,030
A faithful servant, you say?

77
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:41,060
--is a faithful servant supposed to have a hug pillow of her master and drools all over it?

78
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:49,560
Shalltear, embarrassing me in front of the Supreme One, You'd better be prepared.

79
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:58,730
Ara ara~there are wrinkles forming on your face~isn't that a big problem for a succubus?

80
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,600
Let's settle this outside!!

81
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:07,630
Enough.of this.already! We are.before the.Supreme One.

82
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:09,530
Hh! My deepest apologies!

83
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:10,930
I'm terribly sorry!

84
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,260
What.a shameless.bunch.

85
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:20,130
This happens all the time, it's about time you learn from it.

86
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:26,460
If you may, Ainz-sama, Please continue the rest.

87
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:36,850
Actually to repay everyone's work, I am planning to introduce a welfare system to Nazarick.

88
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:42,200
 Wel-fare system? What is that?

89
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:47,050
 The world that I was previously living in had something called a 'company'

90
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:51,700
 Well, you could think of it as something like a guild.

91
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:54,550
 It would take a long time if I were to explain it in detail...

92
00:07:54,550 --> 00:08:02,450
Basically it is the name of the system a company offers to their members, to help them work comfortably.

93
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:11,700
 (In reality there are many companies that don't maintain it though. I have never　benefited from it after all.)

94
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,500
 A service, huh...

95
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:22,850
Exactly. For a start, I am thinking of building　new facilities that you wish for inside Nazarick.

96
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:29,400
Making Nazarick more comfortable would contribute to the reinforcement of Nazarick after all.

97
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,050
Do you have any wishes?

98
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:41,450
Ainz-sama... I think it is a great proposal, but Nazarick already has enough variety of facilities in my opinion.

99
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:45,500
9th floor even has a Spa Resort and a Bar after all.

100
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:52,300
There is even a Nail Saloon. Thanks to that I can preserve my beautiful nails.

101
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:59,650
From.a.Snowy.Mountain, to.a.Jungle. I.Think.it.Would.be.Harder.to Find.Something.We.Don't.Have.

102
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:02,250
Hmmm, I see...

103
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,250
Umm...

104
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:08,450
Oh, it's rare to see Mare speak!

105
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:15,900
Recently, after talking with Ainz-sama I was thinking about it...

106
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:22,550
No need to be reserved, Nazarick is your　place too.

107
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:26,250
Any kind of wish will be made real.

108
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:29,550
Then.. I want to request an ocean!

109
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:31,250
An ocean, is it?

110
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:40,200
Yes! I was thinking if we had an ocean near the jungle in the 6th floor, we could raise many more animals and plants!

111
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:44,550
You... There　is something called a limit in everything!

112
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:48,650
Was that no　good, after all?

113
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:54,700
Well, for now I am just hearing your opinions.

114
00:09:54,700 --> 00:10:01,400
Hmmm... If I were to say it, maybe a torture room?

115
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:05,400
We.Already.Have.a.Torture.Room in.the.5th.Floor don't.We?

116
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:14,700
You see, I want more variation. Fire torturing, water torturing,　ishidaki (rock cradling), medication and　maybe Sai no Kawara (Torture of Dead Men) could be good too.

117
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,700
I-I see...

118
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:19,150
What about you onee-chan?

119
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:26,700
Me? I guess maybe an animal training facility that I can swing my whip　with all my strength.

120
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:30,650
How.is.That.Any.Different From.a.Torture.Room?

121
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:37,050
Training and torture is entirely different! You can't call it training, if you don't put love in it!

122
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:41,650
You can't call it torture either if you don't do it with love, Aura.

123
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:42,650
Is that so?

124
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:46,850
Ainz-sama! May I humbly ask for something?

125
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:49,100
Y-Yeah. I don't mind.

126
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:54,900
If it can be done, could we have a children's room?

127
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,100
Haah?

128
00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:05,950
It would have pink walls, a hanging toy from the ceiling and a baby bed at the center.

129
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:10,050
Why would you need such a thing?

130
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:12,650
It doesn't concern you does it?

131
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:22,250
Well if you want to make one, you can do it, but I will be partaking in the design.

132
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:29,550
The walls black, the hanging toy will be a bat and the baby bed will be changed into a cradle.

133
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:31,850
Why are you intervening!?

134
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:38,350
Of course, I will be first one who will be using that room after all.

135
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:44,400
It seems like we need to settle this fight, Shalltear.

136
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:50,550
Oh, why do we need to carry out a fight that we know the result of?

137
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:58,250
Yes you are right, of course I will be the one who bears the child of the Supreme Being even if we don't...

138
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:03,050
Ainz-sama, lets talk about the decoration of the room!

139
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:07,350
GET AWAY FROM AINZ-SAMA YOU BITCH!

140
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:10,600
BE QUIET!!

141
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,050
I am very sorry!

142
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:14,450
Forgive my insolence!

143
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:17,500
Isn't this a Déjà vu?

144
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:25,450
Sigh... This topic will be carried over to the next discussion. Dismissed!

145
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,700
Ainz-sama, where are you going?

146
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,700
Its a personal business.
